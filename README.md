# OpenCOVID.ca Dashboard
A Jupyter notebook for making quick and dirty visualizations of Canadian COVID statistics using data from the OpenCOVID API. 

[Github doesn't want to display the plotly stuff properly, so here it is on Colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dZXswXSMJOFXXNXbHEXR1N-4W06FJ3YG?usp=sharing)

## Update: 29 Apr 2024
I went back to update this notebook to add comparisons between forecasts and actual data; unfortunately, it seems as if the API for OpenCOVID is no longer accessible. :(
The data appear to have been preserved, so I've forked it, and eventually might restore functionality using the backed up data.
